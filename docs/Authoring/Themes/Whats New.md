# What's New
This document is meant for those who want to update their themes to the newest version, but aren't sure what needs to be added (both file-wise and line-wise), with commentary on what exactly the new items *are*.  Currently, the milestone client versions for this document are as follows:

 - v2.6.0 (This is the assumed "minimum" version)
	 - Released December 15th, 2018
 - [v2.6.2](#whats-new-in-v262)
	 - Released July 27th, 2019
 - [v2.8.4](#whats-new-in-v28x)
	 - Released July 31st, 2020
 - [v2.8.5](#whats-new-in-v28x)
	 - Released August 21st, 2020
 - [v2.9.0](#whats-new-in-v290)
	 - Released March 6th, 2021
 - [v2.9.1](#whats-new-in-v291)
	 - Released May 3rd, 2021

If you don't see a "What's new in X" for any of the aforementioned versions, that means there was no update to client themes since the previous release.

> ***PLEASE NOTE*** that in all the supplementary downloads included in this document, any files with the suffix `_new[versionnumber]` include *only* the new lines that need to be added to your pre-existing files! The bracket references used throughout the rest of the document have also been removed from these files, too!

### courtroom_design.ini

```ini
; **COORDINATE SYSTEM RELATIVE TO "viewport"**
; x/y coordinates 0,0 will start at top-left of the "viewport" for everything below until specified otherwise.
;; These icons are played whenever evidence is presented - It's the animation prior to actually showing what the presented evidence is!
left_evidence_icon = [x, y, width, height]
right_evidence_icon = [x, y, width, height]
; These two are casing-related inputs.
; "casing" is a tickbox that toggles whether you should receive case alerts or
; not (you can set your preferences, and its default value, in the Settings!)
; "casing_button" is an interface to help you announce a case (you have to be
; a CM first to be able to announce cases). 
casing = [x, y, width, height]
casing_button = [x, y, width, height]

## What's new in v2.8.x?
Download for the new files in Default Theme [here](https://pipe.miroware.io/608e2adda333fb12a3ace7c4/AO%20Default%20Theme%20Changes/Theme%20Additive%20for%20v2.8.x.7z)

> `lobby_fonts.ini` is pre-filled out, taken directly from 2.8.5's `default` theme. This is because it is a new file added with this version, and will not be documented here.

### Brief Overview
- Added in-client iniswapping via a dropdown menu that refers to `iniswaps.ini`
- Added a visible Music Display - Now you don't need to scroll through IC logs to see what's playing!
- Added customizable emote button sizes (used to be hardcoded as a 40x40 button)
- Added a Sound Effects dropdown menu. No more need to tie Sound Effects to specific sprites (but you still can if you want to)!
- Added a visible effects dropdown, as well as the ability to let themes have their own visible effects that they can use. (You can find more on the character-specific side in the Characters Overview document)
- Additive text option (Add onto your last statement without refreshing the IC Viewport)
- Screenshakes
- Public and Private Evidence screens - No need to advertise to witnesses (and the other benches) what you have in unscripted cases!

## What's new in v2.9.1?
Download for the new files in Default Theme [here](https://pipe.miroware.io/608e2adda333fb12a3ace7c4/AO%20Default%20Theme%20Changes/Theme%20Additive%20for%20v2.9.1.7z)
### Brief Overview
 - Updated the Settings Menu (nothing you need to worry about)
 - Added Subthemes & Parent Themes systems
 - Added compatibility with Animated UI Elements
	 - If you're having issues with any of the interjection bubbles replacing their button counterparts, rename the bubbles to `[original name]_bubble`. This is caused by AO's hierarchy of file formats, where animated images are favored over still images.
 - *COMPLETE* exposure of the client's Qt Objects. Qt CSS Stylesheets are very powerful, so beware!
 - (Something about [clipping AOImage objects](https://github.com/AttorneyOnline/AO2-Client/pull/322), reminder to get clarification from in1tiate later)
