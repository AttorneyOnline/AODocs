### Sound Effects

Sound effects are located in `base/sounds/general` and can be `.wav`, `.ogg`, or `.opus`. There is no restriction to length. Typically, a sound effect will stop once another character begins talking.

#### Blips

Since 2.8, you can add blips in the `base/sounds/blips` folder instead of in `base/sounds/general`.
